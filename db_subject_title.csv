고2,23년,11월,21,"The arts and aesthetics offer emotional connection to the full range of human experience. “The arts can be more than just sugar on the tongue,” Anjan Chatterjee, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, says. “In art, when there's something challenging, which can also be uncomfortable, this discomfort, if we‘re willing to engage with it, offers the possibility of some change, some transformation. That can also be a powerful aesthetic experience.” The arts, in this way, become vehicles to contend with ideas and concepts that are difficult and uncomfortable otherwise. When Picasso painted his masterpiece Guernica in 1937, he captured the heartbreaking and cruel nature of war, and offered the world a way to consider the universal suffering caused by the Spanish Civil War.

고2,23년,11월,22,"Many historians have pointed to the significance of accurate time measurement to Western economic progress. The French historian Jacques Le Goff called the birth of the public mechanical clock a turning point in Western society. Until the late Middle Ages, people had sun or water clocks, which did not play any meaningful role in business activities. Market openings and activities started with the sunrise and typically ended at noon when the sun was at its peak. But when the first public mechanical clocks were introduced and spread across European cities, market times were set by the stroke of the hour. Public clocks thus greatly contributed to public life and work by providing a new concept of time that was easy for everyone to understand. This, in turn, helped facilitate trade and commerce. Interactions and transactions between consumers, retailers, and wholesalers became less irregular. Important town meetings began to follow the pace of the clock, allowing people to better plan their time and allocate resources in a more efficient manner.

It was an excellent device that would make it easy for shoppers to buy as much as they wanted without getting tired or seeking others' help. But Goldman discovered that in spite of his repeated advertisements and explanations, he could not persuade his shoppers to use the wheeled carts. Men were reluctant because they thought they would appear weak if they pushed such carts instead of carrying their shopping. Women wouldn‘t touch them because the carts reminded them of baby carriages. It was only a few elderly shoppers who used them. That made the carts even less attractive to the majority of the shoppers. Then Goldman hit upon an idea. He hired several models, men and women, of different ages and asked them to wheel the carts in the store and shop. A young woman employee standing near the entrance told the regular shoppers, ’Look, everyone is using the carts. Why don‘t you?’ That was the turning point.

고2,23년,11월,40,"Multiple laboratory studies show that cooperative people tend to receive social advantages from others. One way to demonstrate this is to give people the opportunity to act positively or negatively toward contributors. For example, Pat Barclay, a professor at the University of Guelph, had participants play a cooperative game where people could contribute money toward a group fund which helped all group members, and then allowed participants to give money to other participants based on their reputations. People who contributed more to the group fund were given responsibility for more money than people who contributed less. Similar results have been found by other researchers. People who contribute toward their groups are also chosen more often as interaction partners, preferred as leaders, rated as more desirable partners for long-term relationships, and are perceived to be trustworthy and have high social status. Uncooperative people tend to receive verbal criticism or even more severe punishment.","A. 적절한 주제와 요지를 고르세요

고2,23년,11월,41,"In Western society, many music performance settings make a clear distinction between performers and audience members: the performers are the “doers” and those in the audience take a decidedly passive role. The performance space itself may further reinforce the distinction with a physical separation between the stage and audience seating. Perhaps because this distinction is so common, audiences seem to greatly value opportunities to have special “access” to performers that affords understanding about performers' style of music. Some performing musicians have won great approval by regularly incorporating “audience participation” into their concerts. Whether by leading a sing-along activity or teaching a rhythm to be clapped at certain points, including audience members in the music making can boost the level of engagement and enjoyment for all involved. Performers who are uncomfortable leading audience participation can still connect with the audience simply by giving a special glimpse of the performer perspective. It is quite common in classical music to provide audiences with program notes. Typically, this text in a program gives background information about pieces of music being performed and perhaps biographical information about historically significant composers. What may be of more interest to audience members is background information about the very performers who are onstage, including an explanation of why they have chosen the music they are presenting. Such insight can make audience members feel closer to the musicians onstage, both metaphorically and emotionally. This connection will likely enhance the expressive and communicative experience.","A. 적절한 주제와 요지를 고르세요

It takes far longer for their system to eliminate the same amount of caffeine. As a result, they are very sensitive to caffeine’s effects.

For example, in most places a consumer in search of a quick meal has many choices, and more fast­food restaurants appear all the time. These competing firms advertise heavily. The temptation is to see advertising as driving up the price of a product without any benefit to the consumer. However, this misconception doesn’t account for why firms advertise. In markets where competitors sell slightly differentiated products, advertising enables firms to inform their customers about new products and services. Yes, costs rise, but consumers also gain information to help make purchasing decisions. Consumers also benefit from added variety, and we all get a product that’s pretty close to our vision of a perfect good — and no other market structure delivers that outcome. ","A. 적절한 주제와 요지를 고르세요

It is the sort of space that makes one instinctively think that only a human being — and a human with a remarkably refined creative sensibility, at that — could design something so aesthetically impressive. Yet the auditorium was, in fact, designed algorithmically, using a technique known as “parametric design.” The architects gave the system a set of criteria, and it generated a set of possible designs for the architects to choose from. Similar software has been used to design lightweight bicycle frames and sturdier chairs, among much else. Are these systems behaving “creatively”? No, they are using lots of processing power to blindly generate varied possible designs, working in a very different way from a human being.","A. 적절한 주제와 요지를 고르세요

Although the brain accounts for merely 3 percent of a person’s body weight, it consumes 20 percent of the available fuel. Your brain can’t store fuel, however, so it has to “pay as it goes.” Since your brain is incredibly adaptive, it economizes its fuel resources. Thus, during a period of high stress, it shifts away from the analysis of the nuances of a situation to a singular and fixed focus on the stressful situation at hand. You don’t sit back and speculate about the meaning of life when you are stressed. Instead, you devote all your energy to trying to figure out what action to take. Sometimes, however, this shift from the higher­thinking parts of the brain to the automatic and reflexive parts of the brain can lead you to do something too quickly, without thinking.

고2,23년,9월,39,"Much research has been carried out on the causes of engagement, an issue that is important from both a theoretical and practical standpoint: identifying the drivers of work engagement may enable us to manipulate or influence it. The causes of engagement fall into two major camps: situational and personal. The most influential situational causes are job resources, feedback and leadership, the latter, of course, being responsible for job resources and feedback. Indeed, leaders influence engagement by giving their employees honest and constructive feedback on their performance, and by providing them with the necessary resources that enable them to perform their job well. It is, however, noteworthy that although engagement drives job performance, job performance also drives engagement. In other words, when employees are able to do their jobs well — to the point that they match or exceed their own expectations and ambitions — they will engage more, be proud of their achievements, and find work more meaningful.

고2,23년,9월,41,"In England in the 1680s, it was unusual to live to the age of fifty. This was a period when knowledge was not spread widely, there were few books and most people could not read. As a consequence, knowledge passed down through the oral traditions of stories and shared experiences. And since older people had accumulated more knowledge, the social norm was that to be over fifty was to be wise. This social perception of age began to shift with the advent of new technologies such as the printing press. Over time, as more books were printed, literacy increased, and the oral traditions of knowledge transfer began to fade. With the fading of oral traditions, the wisdom of the old became less important and as a consequence being over fifty was no longer seen as signifying wisdom.
We are living in a period when the gap between chronological and biological age is changing fast and where social norms are struggling to adapt. In a video produced by the AARP (formerly the American Association of Retired Persons), young people were asked to do various activities ‘just like an old person’.

In animals rewarded for noticing sound (to hunt or to avoid being hunted for example), we find much larger auditory centers in the brain. In animals rewarded for sharp eyesight, the visual areas are larger.  Brain scans of violinists provide more evidence, showing dramatic growth and expansion in regions of the cortex that represent the left hand, which has to finger the strings precisely, often at very high speed.

고1,24년,6월,33,"How did the human mind evolve? One possibility is that competition and conflicts with other human tribes caused our brains to evolve the way they did. A human tribe that could out-think its enemies, even slightly, possessed a vital advantage.  The ability of your tribe to imagine and predict where and when a hostile enemy tribe might strike, and plan accordingly, gives your tribe a significant military advantage. The human mind became a weapon in the struggle for survival, a weapon far more decisive than any before it. And this mental advantage was applied, over and over, within each succeeding generation.   The tribe that could out-think its opponents was more likely to succeed in battle and would then pass on the genes responsible for this mental advantage to its offspring.

고1,24년,6월,34,"To find the hidden potential in teams, instead of brainstorming, we‘re better off shifting to a process called brainwriting. The initial steps are solo. You start by asking everyone to generate ideas separately. Next, you pool them and share them anonymously among the group. To preserve independent judgment, each member evaluates them on their own. Only then does the team come together to select and refine the most promising options. By developing and assessing ideas individually before choosing and elaborating them, teams can surface and advance possibilities that might not get attention otherwise. This brainwriting process makes sure that all ideas are brought to the table and all voices are brought into the conversation.

When the grey arrived from America in the 1870s, both squirrel species competed for the same food and habitat, which put the native red squirrel populations under pressure. The grey had the edge because it can adapt its diet; it is able, for instance, to eat green acorns, while the red can only digest mature acorns. Within the same area of forest, grey squirrels can destroy the food supply before red squirrels even have a bite. Greys can also live more densely and in varied habitats, so have survived more easily when woodland has been destroyed.

Hunter- gatherers typically moved around frequently, and they had to be able to carry all their possessions with them every time they moved. In particular, mothers had to carry their young children. As a result, hunter-gatherer mothers could have only one baby every four years or so, spacing their births so that they never had to carry more than one child at a time. Farmers, on the other hand, could live in the same place year  after year and did not have to worry about transporting young   children long distances.

고1,24년,6월,41,"All humans, to an extent, seek activities that cause a degree of pain in order to experience pleasure, whether this is found in spicy food, strong massages, or stepping into a too­cold or too­hot bath. The key is that it is a ‘safe threat’. The brain perceives the stimulus to be painful but ultimately non­threatening. Interestingly, this could be similar to the way humor works: a ‘safe threat’ that causes pleasure by playfully violating norms. We feel uncomfortable, but safe. In this context, where  survival is clearly not in danger, the desire for pain is actually the desire for a reward, not suffering or punishment. This reward­like effect comes from the feeling of mastery over the pain.  The closer you look at your chilli­eating habit, the more remarkable it seems. When the active ingredient of chillies —  capsaicin — touches the tongue, it stimulates exactly the same receptor that is activated when any of these tissues are burned.  Knowing that our body is firing off danger signals, but that we are actually completely safe, produces pleasure. All children start off hating chilli, but many learn to derive pleasure from it through repeated exposure and knowing that they will never experience any real harm. Interestingly, seeking pain for the pain itself appears to be uniquely human. The only way scientists have trained animals to have a preference for chilli or to self­harm is to have the pain always directly associated with a pleasurable reward.","A. 적절한 주제와 요지를 고르세요
