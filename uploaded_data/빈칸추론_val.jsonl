In this sense, mental development consists of internalizing social patterns and gradually becoming a responsible actor among other responsible actors. In Denmark, the age of criminal responsibility is 15 years, which means that we then say that people have developed sufficient mental maturity to be accountable for their actions at this point. And at the age of 18 people are given the right to vote and are thereby formally included in the basic democratic process. I do not know whether these age boundaries are optimal, but it is clear that mental development takes place at different rates for different individuals, and depends especially on the social and family environment they have been given. Therefore, having formal limits for responsibility from a specific age that apply to everyone is a somewhat questionable practice.

The blanks should replace words or phrases that are crucial to the core content or require understanding the flow of the text to answer correctly.\n3. Options for Each Blank:\n  (1) Provide five options for each blank.\n  (2) Each set of options should contain 1 or 2 correct answers.\n  (3) Ensure that the correct answers for the blanks are different from the original text.\n  (4) The distribution of correct answers should be random for each blank to prevent users from predicting them.\n  (5) All options should be grammatically and stylistically correct when inserted into the blank.\n  (6) The incorrect options (distractors) should be plausible and contextually relevant, challenging the student to think critically.\n  (7) Ensure that the options are of a similar difficulty level.\n\n4.

In this sense, mental development consists of internalizing social patterns and gradually becoming a responsible actor among other responsible actors. In Denmark, the age of criminal responsibility is 15 years, which means that we then say that people have developed sufficient mental maturity to be accountable for their actions at this point. And at the age of 18 people are given the right to vote and are thereby formally included in the basic democratic process. I do not know whether these age boundaries are optimal, but it is clear that mental development takes place at different rates for different individuals, and depends especially on the social and family environment they have been given. Therefore, having formal limits for responsibility from a specific age that apply to everyone is a somewhat questionable practice. But the question, of course, is whether it can be done any differently.\r\n\r\n\r\n<<Output>>\r\nMental development consists of individuals increasingly mastering social codes and signals themselves, which they can master only in social situations with the support of more competent individuals, typically adults.
