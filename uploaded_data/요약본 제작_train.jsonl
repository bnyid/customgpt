The tariff that protects steelworkers raises the price of the steel that domestic automobile makers need to build their cars. \r\nAs a result, domestic automobile manufacturers have to raise the prices of their cars, making them relatively less attractive than foreign cars. \r\nRaising prices tends to reduce domestic car sales, so some domestic autoworkers lose their jobs.\r"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1-2 (\uac1c\ub150 \uc18c\uac1c : \uc758\ub3c4\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uacb0\uacfc\uc758 \ubc95\uce59)\n\uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \ub54c, \ud2b9\uc815 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uadf8 \uc815\ucc45\uc774 \uac00\uc9c0\ub294 \ub2e4\ub978 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub4e4\uc744 \ubb34\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.\n3-4 (\uc608\uc2dc \uc2dc\uc791 : \ucca0\uac15\uc5c5 \ubcf4\ud638 \uc815\ucc45)\n\uc678\uad6d\uc0b0 \ucca0\uac15\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub192\uc740 \uad00\uc138\ub97c \ubd80\uc5ec\ud558\uba74, \uad6d\ub0b4 \ucca0\uac15\uc5c5\uc740 \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \ubc1b\uaca0\uc9c0\ub9cc (=\ud2b9\uc815 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \ud574\uacb0)\n5-9 (\ucca0\uac15\uc5c5 \ubcf4\ud638\uc815\ucc45\uc758 \ubd80\uc791\uc6a9 : \uc790\ub3d9\ucc28 \uc0b0\uc5c5)\n\uad00\uc138 \uc870\uce58\ub85c \uc778\ud574\uc11c, \uc790\ub3d9\ucc28 \uc0b0\uc5c5\uacc4\ub294 \uad00\uc138\uac00 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \ub354 \ube44\uc2fc \uac00\uaca9\uc5d0 \ucca0\uac15\uc81c\ud488\uc744 \uad6c\ub9e4\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0, \uc790\ub3d9\ucc28 \uac00\uaca9\uc774 \ub354 \ube44\uc2f8\uc838 \uc678\uad6d\uacfc\uc758 \uacbd\uc7c1\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd88\ub9ac\ud574 \uc9c4\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\uba74 \ub9e4\ucd9c\uc774 \uac10\uc18c\ud558\uac8c\ub418\uc5b4 \uad00\ub828 \uc885\uc0ac\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 \uc77c\uc790\ub9ac\ub97c \uc783\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.
