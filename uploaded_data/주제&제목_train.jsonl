Until the late Middle Ages, people had sun or water clocks, which did not play any meaningful role in business activities. Market openings and activities started with the sunrise and typically ended at noon when the sun was at its peak. But when the first public mechanical clocks were introduced and spread across European cities, market times were set by the stroke of the hour. Public clocks thus greatly contributed to public life and work by providing a new concept of time that was easy for everyone to understand. This, in turn, helped facilitate trade and commerce.

These insights are often covered up when we bring causality back into the picture. For instance, a used-car dealer supplied data to statisticians to predict which of the vehicles available for purchase at an auction were likely to have problems. A correlation analysis showed that orange-colored cars were far less likely to have defects. Even as we read this, we already think about why it might be so: Are orange-colored car owners likely to be car enthusiasts and take better care of their vehicles? Or, is it because orange-colored cars are more noticeable on the road and therefore less likely to be in accidents, so they're in better condition when resold? Quickly we are caught in a web of competing causal hypotheses. But our attempts to illuminate things this way only make them cloudier.  Correlations exist; we can show them mathematically.

The causes of engagement fall into two major camps: situational and personal. The most influential situational causes are job resources, feedback and leadership, the latter, of course, being responsible for job resources and feedback. Indeed, leaders influence engagement by giving their employees honest and constructive feedback on their performance, and by providing them with the necessary resources that enable them to perform their job well. It is, however, noteworthy that although engagement drives job performance, job performance also drives engagement. In other words, when employees are able to do their jobs well \u2014 to the point that they match or exceed their own expectations and ambitions \u2014 they will engage more, be proud of their achievements, and find work more meaningful.

This was a period when knowledge was not spread widely, there were few books and most people could not read. As a consequence, knowledge passed down through the oral traditions of stories and shared experiences. And since older people had accumulated more knowledge, the social norm was that to be over fifty was to be wise. This social perception of age began to shift with the advent of new technologies such as the printing press. Over time, as more books were printed, literacy increased, and the oral traditions of knowledge transfer began to fade. With the fading of oral traditions, the wisdom of the old became less important and as a consequence being over fifty was no longer seen as signifying wisdom.\nWe are living in a period when the gap between chronological and biological age is changing fast and where social norms are struggling to adapt. In a video produced by the AARP (formerly the American Association of Retired Persons), young people were asked to do various activities \u2018just like an old person\u2019.

They designed their own uniforms and had authority over shifts while all the manufacturing processes and pay scales stayed the same.

Farmers, on the other hand, could live in the same place year  after year and did not have to worry about transporting young   children long distances.

Interestingly, this could be similar to the way humor works: a \u2018safe threat\u2019 that causes pleasure by playfully violating norms. We feel uncomfortable, but safe. In this context, where  survival is clearly not in danger, the desire for pain is actually the desire for a reward, not suffering or punishment.
